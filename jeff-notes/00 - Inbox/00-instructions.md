# Your Inbox

Throughout the day, this is a good place to capture quick notes. Don't worry about making them fully fleshed out, just enough to remember something for later.

At the end of each day please *process* this inbox by:

- Creating more specific notes in the folders below, or adding to existing notes.
- Doing more research (Google, Copilot, asking the instructor) on those topics that:
    1. Excite you.
    2. Confuse you.

## The Folder Structure

This is just a suggestion - though I'd like you to try to use it during this course. Ultimately you have to find something that works for you. 

Having a [[Single Point of Truth]] for all your notes is the important thing. 

Use whatever tool you like. OneNote, word docs, etc. 

I prefer [[Plain Text]] because it is always searchable, versionable, etc.

We are going to store these on Github during the class, so be careful to be absolutely ZERO company information in these notes for the time being.

The Folders:

### 00 - Inbox

This folder. The big rule here is that there are no rules - you can throw stuff in here, paste stuff from the internet, whatever. Zero structure. It is the "junk drawer".

**However** make a regular time to *process* your inbox. I like, normally, to let it *fester* a while. Not too long. I try to process my inbox every Friday afternoon. 

I basically create one note for every day, and go through those, but whatever works for you.

> You can create a new daily note by hitting Ctrl+Shift+P and typing "daily" - this is using the Foam extension. It puts the daily note in the root of your project, which is fine. I move mine to the archive folder after I've processed it.


- Just read through everything quickly. 
- Some notes you will discover are *ephemeral* - just junk you needed to perform a task and will never need again. Delete those.
- Some notes are just about things you heard, or found or jotted down during a meeting. Those will go in `40 - Inspiration` and we'll go through that in a bit.
- Hopefully some of your notes start presenting a concept to you. Or they are code samples, related to a specific topic. Work to move those into the appropriate folders.
- Some will be resources - like a note about someone you met, or heard talk in a meeting, or whatever. (I like to keep links to resources on the internet related to a concept or something specifically code oriented in those folders, but you do you.)

## 10 - Concepts

These are ever-evolving, but I like to do them numbered, with the most general at the top (so, lowest numbers) and more specific towards the bottom. In coding, the most specific is always the code itself, and we have another folder for that. 

I've created a *bit* of a structure to get us started, but that might change even during this class.

> *Personal Preference* - I like to use a numbering scheme simply because it makes searching easier. I can do a search for `10.60.20`, for example, and it should show me *any* notes I have for that, but, also, as you'll see, I "tag" my code samples with these too.

## 20 - Code Samples

I've tried all sorts of ways to organize these, but what works best for me is not worrying about organizing them too much - But make them searchable.

- Every code sample *should* connect to a concept. If you have code samples but there is no connected concept, something's gone wrong.
- Create code samples for two main purposes:
    - 1. Copy and Paste. So you can remember it.
    - 2. To help you understand a concept.
    - 3. Use #tags to help identify overlapping concepts.
    - 4. I use tags pretty lightly, because search is usually enough.

## 30 - Resources

Again, a little free-form, but I usually create folders in here for projects I'm currently working on with either links to or copies of documents, etc. related to those projects.

I also have a "people" folder where I keep notes about people in my life.

## 40 - Inspiration

Really anything, but practically, this is often where I'll start feeling a new "concept" being born. "I Keep hearing people talking about something called Kafka, so I'll create a file called "Kafka.md"". 

Add "ticks" to it as you hear more. When it reaches a critical mass, do some research. 

## 90 - Archive

Frankly, if you keep your notes in git, then you don't need this, but it's the *other* junk drawer.
