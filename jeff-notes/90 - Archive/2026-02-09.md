# 2026-02-09

1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day look at your notes and identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below.  Before you leave for the day - do this.

2. Every morning after today we will start with me asking a random selection of you this question:
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yesterday?
    - What was cool and you want to know more about?
