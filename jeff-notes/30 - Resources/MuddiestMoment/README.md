# "Muddiest Moment" Application

Each day, at the end of the day, you will (as students in this class) open this application and add "Your Muddiest Moment" from the day. There may be more than one, but let's limit it to 1-3.

One short sentence that is an indicator that I need to spend more time on the topic.

Each morning, we will start the class with the instructor (Me! Jeff) displaying a list of everyone's muddiest moments from the day before.

The list will be displayed without attribution to protect anonymity, so give enough detail that I can tell what you are talking about.

If, during the review, you feel enough clarity to remove it from the list, you can do that.
- not sure the best way yet. Have some ideas.
- SSE, refreshing the page, web sockets - technical?

The instructor can also "punt" - can say "We are going to spend a whole day on that later... so" and these will go to a part of the list called "backlog" - which are debts to be paid.

And at the end of THAT day, the process repeats. 

If you have a "moment" from the day before that is still on the list, and the instructor hasn't "punted", you can leave it on the list, and the next day it should be shown as a priority.

In other words - "Nah, I still don't get it."
