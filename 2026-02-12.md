### Coupling and Cohesion
- Coupling "The strength of relationships between code modules"
    - how easy is it to change one thing without needing to change (or break) something else?
    - "Inappropriate Intimacy"
    - We want low coupling.
- Cohesion - "How well things go together"
    - "Junk Pile" - "Incidental Cohesion" - A "Utils" or "Helpers"
    - "Temporal" - have the stuff close at hand to where it is needed and when it is needed.
    - "Functional" - 
    - "Is it the right thingy? Abstraction"

Writing code using the four rules of simple design.
