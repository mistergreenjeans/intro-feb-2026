**Front End**
- Some of your job will not need APIs
- Some of it will need to use APIs that already exist
- Sometimes you will be "ahead of" the APIs that are being built or waiting for the frontend team to say what they need

**Backend**
- General purpose (OpenHost) - anybody or nobody in particular might use this api
- building APIs for OTHER services/apis - internal stuff usually, breaking stuff up
- You will be ahead of them (they have built their consumer yet, you are sort of "Designing it")
- sometimes you build stuff in reaction to specific needs by other services/uis, etc
