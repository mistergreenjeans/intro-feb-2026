**Functional**
    - business rules/requirements and implementing and enforcing them in code.

**Operational**
    - Our code running in production 
    - scaling, reliability, all that.
    - "Runtime vs. "Development Time"
    - "Non-Funcitonal"

**Development**
    - maintaining source control
    - pipelines
    - training
    - documentation

**Testing**
    -old skool thinking was developers cannont have a local environment that replicates production so they can only write Unit Test.
        - Low level, break encapsulation
        - super fast.
**Development**
    - maintaining source control
    - pipelines
    - training
    - documentation

**DevOps**
    - Obervability
    - Feature Toggles
    - Pipelines

**APP**
    - two "services in our app
        - they are both in the same "assembly - pros: can't ship code that doesn't compile
            - this is early bound
        - go our separate ways, but in a "packages", like a nuget package or NPm package or whatever.
            - still early bound
            - the creator of the package can "get ahead of us"
        - making it external - "late bound"
            - the scariest, flakiest way possible. But we need to do it. Sometimes

**Exceptions**
    - nSubstitute
    - ILogger

**System Integration (End to End)**
    - test TEND to be "black box test"
    - Use other testing tools / languages than the system they are testing.
    Playwright - browser automation testing tool - use typescript (can use C#)

**DOTNET**
    - is almost unique in this.
    - It has thing between these.
    - I call this gray box test
    - Systems Test
        - let's us peer under the rung when we have to make sure these other things(side-effects) are happening.
    - Another thing about .Net apis-you can host them in your tests.
