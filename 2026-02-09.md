1. "Muddiest Moment"
    -At the end of each day, look at your notes and identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of 2a below. Before you leave for the day - do this (have one written)

2. prepare to answer for:
    - What do you remeber that was helpful yesterday?
    - What was cool and you want to know more about


Today: 

Notes:
    - **"TFS"** - **"Team Foundation Server"** - a Microsoft tool for source code control
        - centralized version control. (No local branches or commits)
        - out of date
        - if the server is down, nobody can work on it
    - **Git**
        - Decentralized
        - makes onboarding new developers easy - just clone our repo.
            - Containers make this easy (a.k.a. Docker) Let you run software that:
                - Won't break other things on your machine (they are a protective container)
                - an match what you have in your other environments (dev/prod parity)
            - to run "doubles of our backing services that are in production
            - scripts that just run different containers
            - docker has a trhing called "docker compose" that lets you run a bunch of things
            - "aspire" - it lets you create a local development environment and make it so that can be deployed.
                - kubernetes
                    -
        - pick one to be authoratative copy (*origin*)
        - Git stores code that you and your team *OWN* and change. 
        - Don't store other stuff
            -libraries you use (dlls, etc.) - explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
            - other teams code
            - even images

        - git init -> add project to git
        - git add . -> add all files to project (Untracked -> Added)
        - git commit -m "Commit Message" -> make commit
        - gh repo create ->
        - gh browse
    
    - **Continuous Integration**
        - CI/CD
        - No branches, everyone pulls from main at the beginning of the day and merges at the end
        - Smaller commits and merges are easier than bigger merge conflicts
        - Make sure to push/pull daily!
        - Structure code so no two developers should have any reason to work on the same file at the same time (this is why there are lots of small files)
        - organize code around "business features" instead of technical concerns.

    - **Github**
        - Microsoft bought github
        - How can I have all source code *AND* history on every machine;
            - you have the current version you've fetched
            - you have "Deltas" (patches) of all changes
            - Usually that isn't too much.
    - **Azure DevOps** (*ADO*)
        - Github for large companies (stricter security requirements)   
        - host and run easily   
        - (will maybe be absorbed by github) 
    - **Visual Studio**
        - ASP.NET Core Web API
        - .NET core -> cross platform
        - What is a Solution, project, etc?
            - Solution -> workspace
            - Project -> like jar
        - .Api file: 
    
    - **Schedule** for week, 
        - mon tue -> API dev, Developer Testing, Angular, Deployments
        - wed -> Intro to .Net, .net modalities, Practice 1
        - thur -> Developer Testing
        - fri -> Odds and Ends
    - **No binary in src repository** (bad practice but sometimes still used)
        - merge conflicts are impossible to fix
    - Different projects work differently
    - **TCA** - Framework
        - late 90s
        - All user interfaces through webpages
        - Iphone created and an app was needed but TCA was only html webpages
    - **Cloud** 
        - changes way we deal with data (latency etc)
        - some old school .NET Frameworks cannot work on cloud
    - **Databases**
        - Data should be stored in a big database (single opoint of truth)
        - how do we move data into the cloud? is data in sync?
        - Multiple databases to choose from:
            - DB2, SQL Server, MongoDb, Postgres, Cloud offerings.
    - **Enviornments**
        - all the places your code really runs
            - Goal: have code running in each environment from left to right
        - *Development*
        - *Test / Staging"
        - *production*
            - the main environment that the consumer user. *The one that matters*
        - Try to replecate what is in production in every enviornment.
        - "Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)"
            - primary architecture of many big companies
    - distributed applications wil use the SOAP protocol.
    - We will be a "microsoft" shop -.NET
    - **IBM**
        - "Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM" (look at IMB on own time)
        - You can swap processors without turning them off (very reliable and useable)
    - ** building an app **
        - Infrastructure
            - Postgres Database - OIDC/Oauth2
        - Our App
            - Angular App "front end - an API that the Angular app can talk to
        - Gateway
Questions:
- Jeff talked about [[Markdown]] and Foam extension

- Ask about displaying markdown properly
