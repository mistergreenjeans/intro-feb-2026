Today: 

Notes:
    - **"TFS"** - **"Team Foundation Server"** - a Microsoft tool for source code control
        - centralized version control. (No local branches or commits)
        - out of date
    - **Git**
        - Decentralized
        - pick one to be authoratative copy (*origin*)
        - Git stores code that you and your team *OWN* and change. 
        - Don't store other stuff
            -libraries you use (dlls, etc.) - explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
            - other teams code
            - even images

        - git init -> add project to git
        - git add . -> add all files to project (Untracked -> Added)
        - git commit -m "Commit Message" -> make commit
        - gh repo create ->
        - gh browse
    - **Github**
        - Microsoft bought github
        - How can I have all source code *AND* history on every machine;
            - you have the current version you've fetched
            - you have "Deltas" (patches) of all changes
            - Usually that isn't too much.
    - **Azure DevOps** (*ADO*)
        - Github for large companies (stricter security requirements)   
        - host and run easily   
        - (will maybe be absorbed by github) 
    - **Visual Studio**
        - ASP.NET Core Web API
        - .NET core -> cross platform
        - What is a Solution, project, etc?
        - .Api file:
