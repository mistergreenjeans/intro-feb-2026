- **Four rules** 
    - *code passes tests* (meets the requirements)
        - what you've done works
        - understand the problem
    - *Reveals intention*
        - write code that other people can understand
    - *No duplication*
        - Don't Repeat Yourself "DRY"
        - aka use method instead of copying code (otherwise you have to change each instance for changes)
        - Dan North - "RUG"
            - Repeat Until Good"
    - *Fewest Elements*
        - Bugs scale linearly with the number of lines of code.
        - Write the simplest thing you can to solve the problem
        - Elements: variables, decisions, loops
- **If you need the code ask Prof**
- **App**
    - Gateway.api and Muddymoments.api depend on service defaults so that their settings default to the same
    - *Dependencies*
        - have less dependencies because it makes it more complicated, (i.e. gateway and MM can't depend on eachother) 

# MM API Design

## Students

### Adding MM
- Add 1 - 3 MMs to be explored the next day.
    - Title (dev testing)
    - Description (optional, more context for what you're looking for)

```http
POST https://localhost:7059/student/moments
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization """"""

{
    "title": "HTTP",
    "description": "A little fuzzy on the types of resources.. collections, documents?"
}

### Get a list of MM

- A student needs a way to see the list of all their submitted MMs

### Remove an MM

### Edit an MM

## Instructor

### Get a list
Can get a list of all the students aggregated moments in a summary form so they can be addressed.

### Punt
Say "I don't want to lose this, but I promise I'll talk about it later"

## In HTTP - we have three things we can "design", and we have to figure out how to map a business process to these three things.
- Resources - An important thingy we want to expose to the consumber of this service.
    - https://mm.hypertheory-labs.dev/api/students/moments 
        - the scheme - http | https
        - "mm.hypertheory-labs.dev" - known as the "origin" or sometimes the "authority".
        - /api/students/moments - "the path" (to the thing we want, the resource)
    -
- Representation
- Methods
