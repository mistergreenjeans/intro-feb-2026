- **Four rules** 
    - *code passes tests* (meets the requirements)
        - what you've done works
        - understand the problem
    - *Reveals intention*
        - write code that other people can understand
    - *No duplication*
        - Don't Repeat Yourself "DRY"
        - aka use method instead of copying code (otherwise you have to change each instance for changes)
        - Dan North - "RUG"
            - Repeat Until Good"
    - *Fewest Elements*
        - Bugs scale linearly with the number of lines of code.
        - Write the simplest thing you can to solve the problem
        - Elements: variables, decisions, loops
