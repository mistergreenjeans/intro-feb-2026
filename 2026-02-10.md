- **Four rules** 
    - *code passes tests* (meets the requirements)
        - what you've done works
        - understand the problem
    - *Reveals intention*
        - write code that other people can understand
    - *No duplication*
        - Don't Repeat Yourself "DRY"
        - aka use method instead of copying code (otherwise you have to change each instance for changes)
        - Dan North - "RUG"
            - Repeat Until Good"
    - *Fewest Elements*
        - Bugs scale linearly with the number of lines of code.
        - Write the simplest thing you can to solve the problem
        - Elements: variables, decisions, loops
- **If you need the code ask Prof**
- **App**
    - Gateway.api and Muddymoments.api depend on service defaults so that their settings default to the same
    - *Dependencies*
        - have less dependencies because it makes it more complicated, (i.e. gateway and MM can't depend on eachother) 

# MM API Design

## Students

### Adding MM
- Add 1 - 3 MMs to be explored the next day.
    - Title (dev testing)
    - Description (optional, more context for what you're looking for)

What data do we need to probide the
*Authorization <--- Who (part of header)*
```http
POST https://localhost:1337/student/moments
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization """""" (who)

{
    "title": "HTTP",
    "description": "A little fuzzy on the types of resources.. collections, documents?"
}
```


```http
GET https://localhost:1337/student/moments
Authorization: (who)

```

```
200 ok
content-type: application/json

[
    {
        "id": "3879204",
        "title": "HTTP",
        "description": "More On Resources, plz"
        "createdAt": "{{timeStamp}}"
        "addedBy": "sue@company.com"

    }
]
```

- **two https resources**
    - Documents
        - /employees/x999999
        - /students/id_xxxxxx/moments -> don't want to put sensitive info in the url
    - Collections
        - /employees

### Get a list of MM

- A student needs a way to see the list of all their submitted MMs

### Remove an MM

### Edit an MM

## Instructor

### Get a list
Can get a list of all the students aggregated moments in a summary form so they can be addressed.

### Punt
Say "I don't want to lose this, but I promise I'll talk about it later"

## In HTTP - we have three things we can "design", and we have to figure out how to map a business process to these three things.
- Resources - An important thingy we want to expose to the consumber of this service.
    - https://mm.hypertheory-labs.dev/api/students/moments 
        - the scheme - http | https
        - "mm.hypertheory-labs.dev" - known as the "origin" or sometimes the "authority".
        - /api/students/moments - "the path" (to the thing we want, the resource)
    -
- Representation
- Methods

    - webserver makes stateless request
    -*two ways to make web server pass requests to your code:*
        - old - (controllers)
        - New - controllerless minimal APIs

    -*1999 HTTP*
        - V-- still happening --V
        - "SOAP" - XML "The next gen for building distributed XML Web Services
            - 2008 WCF (Windows Communication Foundation)
    -*TCP nowadays*


- **Scott Guthrie**
    - .NET (Asp.net web forms, a cool way to democratize web development)
    - 1998/1999

    - In charge of the Developer Division at Microsoft for Years
    - Now in charge of Azure. THE thing that makes money at Microsoft.
    
    -"Alt.Net" - Austin Texas mostly.
        - MSDN - bad
    
    - JUnit, NUnit

    - Ruby on Rails - MVC
        - One trans-atlantic flight coded up the first version of ASP.NET MVC
        - Include the right way open source with this
            - JQuery - open source
            - AND we are working really hard to make THIS (asp.net mvc) open source


- ASP.Net Web Api was like 99% identical to ASP.NET MVC for web apps

## Services

Code or Code Thingies that own some data and all the process around that data.

(this is a version of the definition given by Dr. Alan Kay when somebody asked him what "Object Oriented" means.)

- Service
    - This service owns Everything about a functional area of our business
    - That means Nobody else should be doing that stuff. This is their job. Stay in your lane.
