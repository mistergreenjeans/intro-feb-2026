    - Faster growth at beginning but slower later because of complexity
    - end of project, less changes can be made.

    different ideas can invest making less velocity at the beginning but more at the end.



- When making C# they wanted to make a language between visual basic and C++

Quiz
**1** When you compile a .NET project, it produces an _assembly_, which is a combination of metadata about the types produced, and the _IL_ (_intermediate language_) that the .NET Runtime (CLR) executes.
    *- JVM:JAVA::CLR:DotNet - Visual Basic .Net - C# - F# (OCAML)*
**2** The major difference between ".NET Core" and what we now call ".NET Framework" is:
    - Core is cross platform and open source, Framework is windows only
    *- .NET Framework - the non-cross platform verision will never get to version 5*
**3** True or _False_: .NET is commercial software and you must pay a license to Microsoft to develop code using .NET.
**4** True or _False_: .NET code must be created using Microsoft Visual Studio, though a free version is available.
**5** What is a solution in .NET?
    - A glorified folder, holds projects. Holds configuration things
    *- FOREVER the file format for solutions was the same, and it was a mess. These were ".snl" files and they had a ton of confusing stuff in it, and would constantly cause merge conflicts that were hard to fix, etc.*
    *- very recently they released a new version .slnx that is much better, and cleaner*
    *- Aas of .knet 10 that is the default.*
**6** What is the purpose of Aspire? At least as far as we are using it.
    - Distributed Application Development. Helps us run and deploy the different applications we have in one nice place.
    *- supports the 'best practice' of Dev/Prod parity from the 12 factor app - orchestrates containers, all that stuff.*
**7** What are the three main things we design when designing an HTTP API?
    -1. Resources (endpoints).
    -2. Methods (actions, ie GET POST PUT DELETE)
    -3. Formats/Representations (req/res structures)
**8** What is meant by the term "Service" as we are using it in our development?
    -  Code that owns some data and all processes around that data
    *- This is pretty much my definition of a "microservices as well.*
**9** What is the difference between using the HTTP protocol scheme and the HTTPS protocol scheme?
    - The s, or the encrypted later between server/client communication
    *- HTTPS is "Transport Layer Security" - tls*
**10** What is a "port" in TCP networking?
    - Port where TCP is lsitening to incoming requests
    *- Each application listening on a particular server that uses TCP must have a unique port*
    *- there are "standard" or well-known ports:*
        - http is 80
        - https is 443
        - mail (smtp) 25
        - sql server 1433
        - postgres 5432
# more notes
*- If your code is calling outside your API project across a network (database, other services, etc)* 
*you MUST use async/await*
    
**DB** 
    1 - Info to connect to database (server, credentials, etc.) - ConnectionStrings
        - Generalized with connection strings
    2 - Open a Connection
        - some library/ package specific for that database.
        - EntityFramework - relational database, easiest by far if you are following the current industry best practice - Apps don't share database.
        - Something lighter, and a popular choice is "dapper"
        - NoSql databases like MongoDb, etc. means the database is not going to enforce rules about data consistence AT ALL
            - If you are sharing this kind of database with other applications, its going to be horrible probably
    3 - Run a Query, wait for results or Run a command.

    1 - async/await
    2 - let the db provider manage connections.

    1 - Connection Pooling
    2 - Networks
        - SRE

**ConnectionString**
    - Do not store connection string in program, do it in PATH
